Within "Starter_Code" are folders containing relevant output. The "Images" folder contains screenshots of the relevant output both in the console of Spyder as well as the text files generated by the code. The "PyBank" directory follows and it contains an "analysis" folder containing the single text document with the Financial Analysis of the CSV file contained in "Resources" written to it. The "main.py" Python script contains the code for a portion of the project. Similarly, the "PyPoll" directory contains the same "analysis" and "Resources" folders for the respective Election Results text ouput and election data CSV file. The "main.py" Python script in this directory contains the code for the other portion of the project.

The goal of the PyBank Financial Analysis is to decribe the data by total months worth of data, total net gain of the budget data, average change of profits/losses from month to month, and the max and min change values. 
The goal of the PyPoll Election Results is to determine the winner by popular vote from the summation of election data.
